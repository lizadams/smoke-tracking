This directory contains the scripts for the smoketracking 
and the python script log_analyzer.

smoketracking - a C Shell program that invokes the log_analyzer program.

This script should be run after you have completed the SMOKE runs for each sector using test_smoketracking_area.csh or test_smoketracking_point.csh or it is called during a run using the smoke_calls.csh script.

To set up the environment on killdevil use
module load git   | loads the path to git within your environment
Then go to the SMK_HOME directory
setenv SMK_HOME /netscr/lizadams/SMOKEv40
cd $SMK_HOME/subsys/smoke/assigns
source ASSIGNS.CARB_base2012.cmaq.saprc
cd /netscr/lizadams/SMOKEv40/subsys/smoke/scripts/run/smoke-tracking
If the files have been removed from /netscr, they are available on /ms under:
